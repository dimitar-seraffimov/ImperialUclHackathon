# ImperialUclHackathon

Theme Announcement:
Think about three companies' products you use in your everyday lifeâ€”big or small, digital or physical. Now imagine: ðŸ”„ If you were founding one of those companies today, what would you do totally differently to change its trajectory? ðŸ“ˆ How would you make it bigger, better, or more impactful? Rethink, innovate, and challenge the status quoâ€”what new paths could you take to rewrite its story? This weekend is your chance to be the visionary founder and explore how bold ideas can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. We canâ€™t wait to see what youâ€™ll come up with!
